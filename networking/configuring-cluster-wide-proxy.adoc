= Configuring a cluster-wide proxy during installation
:context: cluster-wide-proxy-configuration

toc::[]

You can configure a cluster-wide proxy during cluster installation.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Cluster-wide proxy is a functionally-complete feature and suitable for production workloads. There are additional considerations that need to be added to documentation, and until then, this feature is considered a Technology Preview.

== Prerequisites

* You are the cluster owner.
* Your account has sufficient privileges.
* You have added the `ec2.<region>.amazonaws.com`, `elasticloadbalancing.<region>.amazonaws.com`, and `s3.<region>.amazonaws.com` endpoints to your VPC endpoint. These endpoints are required to complete requests from the nodes to the AWS EC2 API. Because the proxy works on the container level, not the node level, you must route these requests to the AWS EC2 API through the AWS private network. Adding the public IP address of the EC2 API to your allowlist in your proxy server is not sufficient.

* You must have a Customer Cloud Subscription (CCS) cluster with a VPC that the proxy can access.
