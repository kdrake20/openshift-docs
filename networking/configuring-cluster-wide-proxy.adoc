= Configuring a cluster-wide proxy during installation
:context: cluster-wide-proxy-configuration

toc::[]

You can configure a cluster-wide proxy during cluster installation.

//OSDOCS-2830 Customer Responsibilities
If you use a cluster-wide proxy, you are responsible for the following:

* Maintaining the availability of the proxy to the cluster.
* Understanding that if the proxy becomes unavailable, then it may impact the health and supportability of the cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Cluster-wide proxy is a functionally-complete feature and suitable for production workloads. There are additional considerations that need to be added to documentation, and until then, this feature is considered a Technology Preview.

== Prerequisites

* You are the cluster owner.
* Your account has sufficient privileges.
* You have added the `ec2.<region>.amazonaws.com`, `elasticloadbalancing.<region>.amazonaws.com`, and `s3.<region>.amazonaws.com` endpoints to your VPC endpoint. These endpoints are required to complete requests from the nodes to the AWS EC2 API. Because the proxy works on the container level, not the node level, you must route these requests to the AWS EC2 API through the AWS private network. Adding the public IP address of the EC2 API to your allowlist in your proxy server is not sufficient.

For information about standard installation prerequisites, see xref:../rosa_getting_started/rosa-aws-prereqs.adoc#prerequisites[AWS prerequisites for ROSA]. For information about the prerequisites for installation using AWS Security Token Service (STS), see xref:../rosa_getting_started_sts/rosa-sts-aws-prereqs.adoc#rosa-sts-aws-prerequisites[AWS prerequisites for ROSA with STS].
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
* You must have a Customer Cloud Subscription (CCS) cluster with a VPC that the proxy can access.

For more information, see xref:../osd_quickstart/osd-quickstart.adoc#osd-getting-started[Getting started with {product-title}] for a basic cluster installation workflow.

//OSDOCS-3290 Transparent Proxy Update
[IMPORTANT]
====
The use of a proxy server to perform TLS re-encryption is currently not supported if the server is acting as a transparent forward proxy where it is not configured on-cluster via the `--http-proxy` or `--https-proxy` arguments.

A transparent forward proxy intercepts the cluster’s traffic, but it is not actually configured on the cluster itself.

//OSDOCS-2630 Proxy Configuration Expectations
ifdef::openshift-rosa[]
[NOTE]
====
You should not attempt to change the proxy or additional trust bundle configuration on the cluster itself. These changes should always be done via the `rosa` command-line tools. Any changes that are made directly to the cluster will be reverted automatically.

You should not attempt to change the proxy or additional trust bundle configuration on the cluster itself. These changes should always be done via the `ocm` command-line tools. Any changes that are made directly to the cluster will be reverted automatically.

[id="trust_bundle_responsibilities_cluster-wide-proxy-configuration"]
=== Responsibilites for additional trust bundles

If you supplied an additional trust bundle file, you are responsible for the following:

* Ensuring that the contents of the additional trust bundle are valid,
* Ensuring that the certificates, including intermediary certificates, contained in the additional trust bundle have not expired, and
* Tracking the expiry and performing any necessary renewals for certificates contained in the additional trust bundle, and subsequently updating the cluster’s configuration with the updated additional trust bundle.
