= Installing the External DNS Operator

You can install the External DNS Operator using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Operator Hub.

.Prerequisites

* You have logged in to the {product-title} web console as a user with `cluster-admin` permissions.
* You have created the operand `external-dns` namespace by running `oc create ns external-dns` command.
* You have granted the operator access to manage operand resources by running `oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/external-dns-operator/release-0.1/config/rbac/extra-roles.yaml` command.

.Procedure

. Click *Operators* â†’ *OperatorHub* in the OpenShift Web Console.
. Click *External DNS Operator*.
  You can use the Filter by keyword text box or the filter list to search for External DNS Operator from the list of operators.
. Select `external-dns-operator` namespace.
. On the External DNS Operator page, click *Install*.
. On the Install Operator page, ensure that you selected the following options:
.. Update the channel as *stable-{product-version}*.
.. Installation mode as *A specific name on the cluster*.
.. Installed namespace as `external-dns-operator`. If Namespace `external-dns-operator` does not exist, it will be created during the operator installation.
.. Select *Approval Strategy* as *Automatic* or *Manual*. Approval Strategy is set to Automatic by default.
.. Click *Install*.

If you select Automatic updates, the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) automatically upgrades the running instance of your operator without any intervention.

If you select Manual updates, the OLM creates an update request. As a cluster administrator, you must then manually approve that update request to have the operator updated to the new version.


.Verification step

Verify that External DNS Operator shows the Status as Succeeded on the Installed Operators dashboard.
