= Deleting a ROSA cluster
:context: rosa-sts-deleting-cluster

toc::[]

Delete a {product-title} (ROSA) cluster using the `rosa` command-line.

[id="prerequisites_rosa-sts-deleting-cluster"]
== Prerequisites

* If {product-title} created a VPC, you must remove the following items from your cluster before you can successfully delete your cluster:
** Network configurations, such as VPN configurations and VPC peering connections
** Any additional services that were added to the VPC

If these configurations and services remain, the cluster does not delete properly.
