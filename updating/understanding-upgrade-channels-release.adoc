In {product-title} 4.1, Red Hat introduced the concept of channels for recommending the appropriate release versions for cluster updates. By controlling the pace of updates, these upgrade channels allow you to choose an update strategy. Upgrade channels are tied to a minor version of {product-title}. For instance, {product-title} 4.7 upgrade channels recommend updates to 4.7 and updates within 4.7. They also recommend updates within 4.6 and from 4.6 to 4.7, to allow clusters on 4.6 to eventually update to 4.7. They do not recommend updates to 4.8 or later releases. This strategy ensures that administrators explicitly decide to update to the next minor version of {product-title}.

Upgrade channels control only release selection and do not impact the version of the cluster that you install; the `openshift-install` binary file for a specific version of {product-title} always installs that version.

ifndef::openshift-origin[]
{product-title} {product-version} offers the following upgrade channels:

* `candidate-{product-version}`
* `fast-{product-version}`
* `stable-{product-version}`
* `eus-4.y` (only when running an even-numbered 4.y cluster release, like 4.6)

[WARNING]
====
Red Hat recommends upgrading to versions suggested by Openshift Update Service only. For minor version update, versions must be contiguous. Red Hat does not test updates to noncontiguous versions and cannot guarantee compatibility with earlier versions.
