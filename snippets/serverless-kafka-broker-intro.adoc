The Knative Kafka broker is an Apache Kafka native implementation of the Knative broker API. It has a better integration with Kafka for the broker and trigger model over other broker types and reduces network hops.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Kafka broker, which is currently in Technology Preview, is not supported on FIPS.
====

The Knative Kafka broker stores incoming CloudEvents as Kafka records, using the binary content mode. This means that all CloudEvent attributes and extensions are mapped as headers on the Kafka record, while the `data` spec of the CloudEvent corresponds to the value of the Kafka record.

If a cluster administrator has configured your {ServerlessProductName} deployment to use Kafka as the default broker type, creating a broker by using the default settings creates a Kafka-based `Broker` object. If your {ServerlessProductName} deployment is not configured to use Kafka broker as the default broker type, you can use one of the following procedures to create a Kafka-based broker.
