= VMware vSphere CSI Driver Operator requirements

The following requirements must be met in order to install the CSI Driver Operator:

* VMware vSphere version 6.7U3 or later
* Virtual machines of hardware version 15 or later
* No third-party CSI driver already installed in the cluster

If a third-party CSI driver is present in the cluster, {product-title} does not overwrite it. The presence of a third-party CSI driver prevents {product-title} from upgrading to 4.11. For more information about removing a third-party CSI driver, see xref:../../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-vsphere.adoc#persistent-storage-csi-vsphere-install-issues_persistent-storage-csi-vsphere[Removing a non-Red Hat vSphere CSI Operator Driver].
