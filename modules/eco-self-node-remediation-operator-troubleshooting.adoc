If the `MachineHealthCheck` controller did not create the `SelfNodeRemediation` CR when the node turned unhealthy, check the logs of the `MachineHealthCheck` controller. Additionally, ensure that the `MachineHealthCheck` CR includes the required specification to use the remediation template.
+
If the `SelfNodeRemediation` CR was created, ensure that its name matches the unhealthy node or the machine object.
