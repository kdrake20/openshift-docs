`emptyDir` volumes are empty volumes that are created when a pod is created, and are used to provide temporary working disk space. `emptyDir` volumes are deleted when the pod they were created for is deleted.

The `"kubernetes.podspec-volumes-emptydir"` extension controls whether `emptyDir` volumes can be used with Knative Serving. To enable using `emptyDir` volumes, you must modify the `KnativeServing` custom resource (CR) to include the following YAML:

[source,yaml]

spec:
  config:
    features:
      "kubernetes.podspec-volumes-emptydir": enabled
