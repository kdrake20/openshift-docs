= RBAC requirements

To expose the backing service binding data using the {servicebinding-title}, you require certain Role-based access control (RBAC) permissions. Specify certain verbs under the `rules` field of the `ClusterRole` resource to grant the RBAC permissions for the backing service resources. When you define these `rules`, you allow the {servicebinding-title} to read the binding data of the backing service resources throughout the cluster.

The {servicebinding-title} performs requests against the Kubernetes API using a dedicated service account. By default, this account has permissions to bind services to workloads, both represented by the following standard Kubernetes or OpenShift objects:

* `Deployments`
* `DaemonSets`
* `ReplicaSets`
* `StatefulSets`
* `DeploymentConfigs`

The Operator service account is bound to an aggregated cluster role, allowing Operator providers or cluster administrators to enable binding custom service resources to workloads. To grant the required permissions within a `ClusterRole`, label it with the `servicebinding.io/controller` flag and set the flag value to `true`. The following example shows how to allow the {servicebinding-title} to `get`, `watch`, and `list` the custom resources (CRs) of Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator:

This cluster role can be deployed during the installation of the backing service Operator.
