= State migration

You can use {mtc-full} ({mtc-short}) to migrate an application's state.

State migration copies selected persistent volume claims (PVCs) and Kubernetes objects that constitute an application's state.

If you have a CI/CD pipeline, you can migrate stateless components by deploying them on the target cluster. Then you can migrate the application's state by using {mtc-short}.

You can migrate an application within the same cluster by using state migration.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not use state migration to migrate namespaces between clusters. Use stage or cutover migration instead.
