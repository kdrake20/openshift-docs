= Preparing the bare metal node

Expanding the cluster requires a DHCP server. Each node must have a DHCP reservation.

ifeval::[{product-version}>4.6]
[IMPORTANT]
.Reserving IP addresses so they become static IP addresses
====
Some administrators prefer to use static IP addresses so that each node's IP address remains constant in the absence of a DHCP server. To use static IP addresses in the {product-title} cluster, *reserve the IP addresses in the DHCP server with an infinite lease*. After the installer provisions the node successfully, the dispatcher script will check the node's network configuration. If the dispatcher script finds that the network configuration contains a DHCP infinite lease, it will recreate the connection as a static IP connection using the IP address from the DHCP infinite lease. NICs without DHCP infinite leases will remain unmodified.

.Procedure

. Power off the bare metal node via the baseboard management controller and ensure it is off.

. Retrieve the user name and password of the bare metal node's baseboard management controller. Then, create `base64` strings from the user name and password.

[source,bash,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ echo -ne "__username__" | base64
----
+
[source,bash,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ echo -ne "__password__" | base64

. Create a configuration file for the bare metal node.

----
+
Replace `num` for the worker number of the bare metal node in the two `name` fields and the `credentialsName` field. Replace `<base64_of_uid>` with the `base64` string of the user name. Replace `<base64_of_pwd>` with the `base64` string of the password. Replace `<NIC1_mac_address>` with the MAC address of the bare metal node's first NIC.
+
See the BMC addressing section for additional BMC configuration options. Replace `<protocol>` with the BMC protocol, such as IPMI, RedFish, or others.
Replace `<bmc_ip>` with the IP address of the bare metal node's baseboard management controller.
+
[NOTE]
====
If the MAC address of an existing bare metal node matches the MAC address of a bare metal host that you are attempting to provision, then the Ironic installation will fail. If the host enrollment, inspection, cleaning, or other Ironic steps fail, the Bare Metal Operator retries the installation continuously. See xref:modules/ipi-install-diagnosing-duplicate-mac-address.adoc#ipi-install-diagnosing-duplicate-mac-address_{context}[Diagnosing a host duplicate MAC address] for more information.
